      <p class="rv d1">Most builders hand the drawing to someone else to price, and hand the price to someone else to build. RAM does not. The same team listens to what matters to you, walks the lot to learn its layout and restrictions, draws the plan, prices it and builds it, so nothing is lost between the sketch and the site.</p>
      <p class="rv d2">Every plan is original and drawn in-house. The budget is established early, before the plans are finalised, with an up-front account of what each feature adds, so change orders are the exception rather than the business model. The drawings that go to the county are the drawings that get built.</p>
      <p class="rv d2">Because a house is hard to see on paper, the lead designer builds an immersive 3D model at the same time as the preliminary plans. You tour every room, fixture and finish before construction begins, and the model is approved by a structural engineer so the changes you make in it can be trusted.</p>
